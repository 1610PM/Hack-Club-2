	<h2> SOME FACTS ABOUT PINK PANTHER </h2>
	<p> This franchise began with the film "The Pink Panther", released in 1963. </p>
	<p>The idea and creation of this character was because in the film, the pink panther was the name of a valuable pink diamond; in the credits, this was animated to be a legit pink panther. </p> 
	<p>Pink Panther is closely associated with "The Pink Panther Theme" that was composed by Henry Mancini.  </p>
